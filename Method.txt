Alternatively, if you prefer the GitHub web interface:

Go to your repository: Open the devops-study repository on GitHub.

Create a new file: Click the "Add file" button and select "Create new file".

Enter the folder name: To create a folder, type the folder name followed by a slash, like this: linux-commands/README.md.

Add content: You can add any content inside the README.md file (or any other file you want to create).

Commit the new file: Scroll down, add a commit message, and click "Commit new file".

This will create the linux-commands folder in your repository on GitHub.
